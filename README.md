xp32 - a graphics demo for DOS
------------------------------

xp32 is an old school graphics demo for the DOS operating system.  It
contains graphics routines, a 'real-time' lightweight process
scheduler, a '3d' vector graphics engine, fire and a number of other
unique graphics hacks along the way.

No audio.

This was originally written in 1997 for my 4th year Computer
Engineering graduate project/thesis course.  My final mark was 100%
and I was told I didn't not have to fulfill the requirement of writing
the paper after the demo I gave my instructor, Greg Bond.  I was happy
at the time to not have the work of writing the paper, but I found as
I grew older the lack of skills in describing my work using words was
never developed to the ability that I've wished for.

Maybe this paper will get written someday.
